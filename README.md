A Magic The Gathering Card Display Utility
----------------------------------------

Welcome to the Helvault!

Helvault is a Magic The Gathering Card Display Utility. This web-app was created to help new and current MTG content creators create great content for the community. 

Specifically, Helvault is a utility that allows you to search for cards using [Scryfall's powerful search engine](https://scryfall.com/), drag and drop them into a PowerPoint-esque slide deck, and use common key commands to cycle between cards on the slide deck, displaying the currently selected card in the large display area. The intent of the display area would be for you, the content creator, to use a program like [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/) to window capture the web browser Helvault is running in, giving you an easy way to change cards being displayed in your video.

My intent for Helvault was to help make video production easier for content producers. For example, if you are doing a live deck tech of paper MTG cards, you can set up Helvault with the cards you are talking about in the order you wish to describe them. That way, while the audience can still see your paper deck, they can have an easier time reading the cards you are referencing without having to deal with variables like sleeve glare, and movement of the cards. This could apply to live recording of podcasts that talk about cards, gameplays, live streams, etc. 

Controls are straight-forward:

> Spacebar or right-arrow: Next slide
> 
> left-arrow: Previous Slide
> 
> Shift-click: Delete Slide

If you have never used Scryfall before, their search syntax guide can be found [here](https://scryfall.com/docs/reference).

Since this is a tool for the community, it made sense to make Helvault open source. If you have ideas or contributions you would like to add to Helvault, feel free to send me a message on github/reddit, or add the feature yourself if you have the skills!

A current working version of Helvault will always be available at [helvault.com](https://www.helvault.com) for content creators to use. If you feel like running Helvault on your own, all you need to download is [Python Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and the Helvault source code. 

I wanted to give a huge thank you to the MTG community for providing countless hours of entertaining and educational content. Hopefully Helvault is a sufficient thank you, as well as a decent tool to help others create more of the content that our community loves. 

All of the best, and happy creating!
